# List-of-commands-in-rhinoceros-8-for-modeling-an-organizer-for-collet
list of commands in rhinoceros, with which you can create a large number of 3D objects  

## Intro  

since the description of the project for creating the [Organizer-for-a-drill-parts-poject](https://github.com/m2415146/Organizer-for-a-drill-parts)  turned out to be quite voluminous and at the same time it did not pay enough attention to the details of 3D modeling, I decided to write out a list of commands that I used to create this project in a separate repository.  

I noticed that using these commands they solve many problems that I am currently facing while learning modeling in rhinoceros. the list will be supplemented, if possible, with details and screenshots, at first it will serve as a synopsis for me, in case I forget any nuances.  

**I also hope that he will be able to help other people create various objects in rhinoceros, because I know how difficult it can be to integrate knowledge into practice so that it turns into a practical skill**
